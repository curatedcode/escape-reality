			id: "general",
			name: "General Questions",
			questions: [
				{
					id: "what-is-escape-room",
					question: "What is an escape room?",
					answer:
						"An escape room is an immersive, interactive adventure game where players are locked in a themed room and must solve a series of puzzles, find clues, and complete objectives within a set time limit (usually 60 minutes) to 'escape' or complete the mission.",
				},
				{
					id: "how-many-players",
					question: "How many players can participate?",
					answer:
						"Our escape rooms accommodate 2-8 players per game. We recommend 4-6 players for the optimal experience, but our rooms are designed to be enjoyable for any group size within that range.",
				},
				{
					id: "age-requirements",
					question: "Are there age requirements?",
					answer:
						"Players of all ages are welcome, but we recommend participants be at least 10 years old to fully enjoy and contribute to the experience. Children under 16 must be accompanied by an adult. Some of our rooms may have specific age recommendations based on theme and difficulty.",
				},
				{
					id: "claustrophobia",
					question: "I'm claustrophobic. Will I be comfortable?",
					answer:
						"Our rooms are spacious and you are never actually locked in. Emergency exits are always available and clearly marked. Game masters monitor the rooms at all times and can assist if you feel uncomfortable. Many claustrophobic guests have enjoyed our games without issues.",
				},
				{
					id: "scary",
					question: "Are the rooms scary?",
					answer:
						"Our rooms are designed to be thrilling and immersive, but not frightening. There are no jump scares, horror elements, or actors that will touch or scare you. The Murder Mystery Mansion has a slightly spooky atmosphere, but it's more intriguing than scary.",
				},
			],
		},
		{
			id: "booking",
			name: "Booking & Pricing",
			questions: [
				{
					id: "how-to-book",
					question: "How do I make a reservation?",
					answer:
						"Reservations can be made online through our booking system, by phone at (941) 555-1234, or by email at info@escaperealitysarasota.com. We recommend booking at least 24-48 hours in advance, especially for weekend slots.",
				},
				{
					id: "pricing",
					question: "How much does it cost?",
					answer:
						"Our standard pricing is $30 per person. We offer discounts for groups of 6 or more, students, military personnel, and seniors. Special rates are available for corporate events and private parties.",
				},
				{
					id: "cancellation-policy",
					question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
					answer:
						"Cancellations made more than 48 hours before your scheduled game receive a full refund. Cancellations within 24-48 hours receive a 50% refund. Cancellations less than 24 hours before your game or no-shows are not eligible for refunds but may be rescheduled within 30 days based on availability.",
				},
				{
					id: "private-bookings",
					question: "Will we be paired with strangers?",
					answer:
						"No, all bookings at Escape Reality Sarasota are private. Your group will have the entire room to yourselves at no additional cost, regardless of group size.",
				},
				{
					id: "gift-cards",
					question: "Do you offer gift cards?",
					answer:
						"Yes! Gift cards are available for purchase online or in person. They make perfect presents for birthdays, holidays, or any special occasion. Gift cards are valid for 12 months from the date of purchase and can be used for any of our escape rooms.",
				},
			],
		},
		{
			id: "gameplay",
			name: "Gameplay & Experience",
			questions: [
				{
					id: "arrive-early",
					question: "How early should we arrive?",
					answer:
						"Please arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled time for check-in and a brief orientation. Late arrivals may result in shortened game time, as we must start other groups on schedule.",
				},
				{
					id: "what-to-bring",
					question: "What should I bring?",
					answer:
						"Just bring yourself and your team! We provide everything needed to solve the puzzles. We recommend wearing comfortable clothing and shoes. Please leave large bags and unnecessary items in your car, as storage space is limited.",
				},
				{
					id: "phones-allowed",
					question: "Can we use our phones during the game?",
					answer:
						"No, phones and other electronic devices are not allowed in the escape rooms. We provide lockers for your belongings. This policy ensures an immersive experience and prevents cheating or damage to the game elements.",
				},
				{
					id: "physical-requirements",
					question: "Is physical activity required?",
					answer:
						"Our games require minimal physical activity. You may need to bend, reach, or move small objects, but there's no climbing, crawling, or heavy lifting. Our rooms are designed to be accessible to most participants.",
				},
				{
					id: "game-master",
					question: "Will someone help us if we get stuck?",
					answer:
						"Yes! A game master monitors your progress throughout the experience. You can request hints if you get stuck, and your game master will provide assistance to ensure you have an enjoyable experience.",
				},
			],
		},
		{
			id: "special-events",
			name: "Special Events & Groups",
			questions: [
				{
					id: "corporate-events",

				},
				{
					id: "birthday-parties",
					question: "Can I host a birthday party?",
					answer:

				},
				{
					id: "large-groups",
					question: "Can you accommodate large groups?",
					answer:
						"Yes, we can accommodate groups of up to 24 people at once across our three rooms. For larger groups, we can arrange staggered start times. Please contact us directly to arrange large group bookings.",
				},
				{
					id: "private-events",
					question: "Can I rent the entire facility?",
					answer:
						"Yes, you can rent our entire facility for private events. This gives you exclusive access to all three escape rooms and our common areas. Perfect for large corporate events, holiday parties, or special celebrations.",
